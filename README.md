- **Subject**: [IMAD5112]

## Links
- **GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/ST10491930/Carpenter-Estimation-App.git]
```

Why:
----
- I created this app in order to determine the costs of work for different carpentry in order to help users to be able to get a proper estimate of the cost of their materials and work services.

---

2. Project Overview
-------------------

## Project Overview

The **[Carpenter Estimation]** is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the [IMAD5112] subject. This application was created using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. The app's primary purpose is to determine the amount of hours needed for a certain project, as well as the materials needed for it and to give the user and estimation on all of these matters before beginning their tasks.

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.
```


3. App Purpose and Features
---------------------------

```markdown
## Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to determine the cost of labour and material.
### Key Features:
- Feature 1: [estimate cost]
- Feature 2: [the amount needed for the project]
- Feature 3: [different materials used]

These features aim to provide a easier method of calculating costs and saving money in different ways.
```


4. Design Considerations
------------------------

```markdown
## Design Considerations

The design of the **[Carpenter Estmation]** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: The app was designed with the goal of providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **Performance**: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.
```

Why:
----
- Highlights the thought process behind the design choices. It demonstrates that students are considering not just the functionality, but also the usability and performance aspects of the app, which is a professional approach.

---

5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization
----------------------------------------
```markdown
## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.
```

Why:
----
- This section educates students on why they should understand version control (GitHub) and automation (GitHub Actions). It shows how they’re adopting industry-standard practices, which is useful for both academic purposes and career development.

7. Challenges and Learnings
---------------------------

```markdown
## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: [Learning how to impliment new features and learning how to use them in different ways"]
   - **Solution**: [Spend more tim exploring and learning how to use all different features in order to help with future development"]
   

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.
```


---

8. Future Enhancements
----------------------

```markdown
## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: ["Allowing users to set up reminders or notifications."]
2. **Feature 2**: [ "Integrating with a cloud database for storing user data."]
3. **Feature 3**: ["Adding a dark mode option for better user experience."]

These enhancements would improve the app’s usability and make it even more versatile for end-users.
```

11. Disclosure of AI Usage in My Assessment
-------------------------------------------

```markdown
## Disclosure of AI Usage in My Assessment

## Disclosure of AI Usage in My Assessment

In the development of this project, I have used generative AI tools to assist in various parts of the assignment. Below is a detailed disclosure of where and how these tools were used:

### 1. **Section(s) in which Generative AI was used:**
-*Design*: Used AI for brainstorming ideas for the app's features.
-*Coding*: Assisted in creating code snippets for setting up GitHub Actions workflows.

### 2. **Name of AI Tool(s) Used:**
- **ChatGPT** 
-**Youtube**

### 3. **Purpose/Intention Behind Use:**
- **Brainstorming**: Used ChatGPT to generate ideas for the app’s features and functionality.
- **Meaning Making**: Used AI to clarify some concepts and gain a better understanding of how certain technologies (e.g., GitHub Actions) work.
- **Initial Investigation**: Utilized AI to conduct research on best practices for Android app development and GitHub Actions setup.


### 4. **Date(s) in Which Generative AI Was Used:**
- **: AI used on **16 April 2025, 2025** for brainstorming feature ideas.
- **: AI used on **14 April , 2025** to help set up GitHub Actions.


### 5. **Link to the AI Chat(s) or Screenshots:**
- **Chat 1 (Brainstorming App Features)**: [Link to the AI conversation/chat](https://chatgpt.com/share/67fffeb5-57cc-8006-b8ac-6cddda40db31)  
  

- **Chat 2 (GitHub Actions Workflow Setup)**: [Link to the AI conversation/chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKlidGCjnds)  
 



```

Why:
----
- The Ai was used in order to make the work more presentable as well as to ensure that the work was correct and to ensure understanding about how certain controls work and the differet ways to use them.
